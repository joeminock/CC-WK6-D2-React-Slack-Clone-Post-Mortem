########## React Slack Clone - Post-mortem ##########

1. What things did you think went well on the project?

A. In the initial group creation of the project, I felt much more comfortable and confident following along and in a few cases moving ahead of the group in creation of the codebase. After consulting an additional react learning resource on Friday evening, I grew even more comfortable with the react framework.

2. What has been frustrating about the project?

A. I did not initially understand props and state as well as I thought I did. As such, I had to essentially relearn what they do... and amd still working through this. Further, I'm still trying to fully grasp all of the javascript concepts learned in weeks 2-4, so my level of confidence in creating net-new codebase is low. Further, due to unexpected events, I was required to be in Denver most of Sunday which killed a whole day of study time and work.

3. How would you do things differently next time to avoid this frustration?

A. I'm trying to do my best to absorb more material during class time through searches of current tasks on Google, Stack Overflow, etc as a means of establishing a broader understanding of concepts. Additionally, I'm continuing to attend Dave's class in the evenings so that I can be further exposed to the concepts that have already been learned and apply them in a more remedial capacity.
